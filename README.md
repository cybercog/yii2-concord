Yii2 - Concord
==============

Yii2 - Concord is a work in progress. This is a project exploring the use of GitHub, Travis CI, Scrutinizer CI, Packagist, PHPUnit and Yii2.  The project so far mostly consists of extensions to the Yii2 Active Record implementation as well as a database connection manager.  At the time of writing, Yii2 is still a moving target and very much in Alpha status.
